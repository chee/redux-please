`or something like this. it's Redux implemented in a tweet. Now this was back
when -- and you may be too young to remember this -- when tweets were only 140
characters.

so that was something. i thought "wow, redux is simple enough to fit in a
tweet." and i *left arrow*

but let's break this out and look at it in a little more detail

Okay. so redux exports a function called \`createStore\`, and that function
takes a reducer.

it returns an object, that we call the store, which has three functions.

getState, which returns us the current state
dispatch, which lets us send an action through the store
and subscribe, which lets us register functions to be told when an action gets
dispatched.

so there's only a couple of concepts we need to look at here,
